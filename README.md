Please be aware that this is a work in progress!

Further, the original inspiration came from [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHsC_t0j1dU)'s YouTube channel. I am actively
still working on this project, but I wanted to publish it a bit early to show my ability to do pipelines using SQL and Python. The rest of my 
portfolio is also a little light on SQL so I felt it important to demonstrate this quality. I plan to first elaborate on the current code and then
expand the project to incorporate other database systems. Integrating web scraping is also a long-term goal for this repository.
